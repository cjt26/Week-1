# Week 1  

## Exercises
In this section, you should provide a **bulleted list** of **links** to exercise chapters you worked on this week. At a minimum, we expect to see substantial progress on the exercises discussed in class (remember, you should be pushing commits to the work you are doing in the `book-exercises-USER-NAME/` repository). For each link (chapter), include a brief note about which skills are covered in the exercise (this will be helpful to come back to!). Feel free to link to the entire chapter, or a specific exercise. For example:

- [Chapter 3, exercise 1](https://github.com/cjt26/Chapter-3-Exercise-1): practiced using a hyperlink for a word

- [Chapter 3, exercise 2](https://github.com/cjt26/Week-1):

| Learned | How to Make          | Columns   |
|-|

- [Chapter 3, exercise 3](https://github.com/cjt26/Week-1): showed how the ls command is helpful

## New Skills and Challenges
In this section, describe the new skills you acquired and challenges you encountered. The format is up to you -- feel free to use a list, a table, sub-headers, or any other format you see fit. Identifying concepts that you find difficult can help you round out your skills in a systematic way.

I learned the basics of `git` and _markdown_. I learned how to change the status of the saved file and push that to **GitHub**

## Specific Code Sections
In this section, add _at least_ 3 code blocks containing code that you found helpful this week. This is your opportunity to keep track of syntax/code skeletons so you can easily come back to them for future use! Make sure to use **code block formatting** and **include comments** with the code. Feel free to also include images, links, or other content that makes this more useful for you!

```
In order to hyperlink a word, you have to [put the word in brackets](and the link in parenthesis)

```
cd can only pull a file location from where you start.
To get back to the desktop, you can do cd ~/desktop
```

```
in order to make a new file, the command is mkdir (make new directory)
```

## Goals for the upcoming week
What are your goals for the upcoming week? Are there any questions that you have that you hope to answer in the coming week?They can be specific and technical (e.g., _practice XX_) or general and more personal (e.g., _work more efficiently on homeworks_). Again, the format here is up to you -- this is also a great place to express your goals and areas of confusion to the TAs so they can provide better support!

> My goals for this week is to understand the R system. I had a difficult time with [chapter 03 exercise 1](https://github.com/info201b-w19/exercises-cjt26/tree/master/chapter-03-exercises/exercise-1). I was able to learn a lot of the techniques but I don't know if I properly connected my terminal to GitHub. MY goal is to learn how to connect it next week.
