# Exercise 2
Using the text-edit of your choice (e.g., Atom), create a new file called `README.md`. Alternatively, you may clone this repository and edit this file.

In your `README.md` document, make a three column table of the current courses you are taking, with separate columns for course number (in **bold**), course title (in _italics_), and instructor name.

Note that you can preview this Markdown in Atom to make sure it works correctly.


| **Course Number**   | Course Title           | Instructor  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| **Com 325**    | _Communication, Cities, and Sustainability_| Professor Rivenburgh |
| **INFO 201**    | _Technololgy Foundations_      |   Professor Freeman|
| **COM 395**| _Internship_      |    To Be Arranged|
